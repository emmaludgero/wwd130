    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>
      We are a society of two sisters: sister one, Emma Katherine, the nerd, and sister two, Maria Victoria, the idea
      maker.
      Maria Victoria graduated in Marketing from Estácio College. She is a Sales Bank. She lives in Curitiba, loves to
      travel, is very organized, and thrives.
      Emma Katherine is a student of Applied Technology from Brigham Young University. She lives in Curitiba, loves to
      design and create, and is fighting for her success.
      We want to travel the world and have something to remember about that marvelous adventure. But sometimes, that's
      not possible. All we have is pictures and the memory. We don't know what to do with those pictures and forget
      about them. And our memory is flawed, so we forget the good times. So, we created this site so that we can provide
      more extended travel moments in our lives.
