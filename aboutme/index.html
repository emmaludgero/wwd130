    <p> Hi guys!</p>
    <p>New paragraph</p>
    <p>My name is Emma Katherine Ribas Ludgero. Most people like to call me Kath. I live in Curitiba, in the Parana
        State, in Brazil. I love my city and my home. The only thing I don't enjoy so much is the cold here, and I
        freeze every time. I was born in a family of five, and I'm the youngest daughter. I love my family. I just
        finished the Pathway, and this is my first semester at BYU. My major is Applied Technology, and I'm taking three
        classes this semester. I'm nervous about it, but I'm excited too. I hope to learn and make the best use of my
        classes. I love the gospel of Jesus Christ. He's my rock and my Redeemer. All I have is because of Him, so I'm
        eternally grateful for Him and Heavenly Father.</p>
        <p>Best wishes,</p>
        <p>Emma Ludgero</p>
